The Connectinn dataset relates to the study of non bothersome tinnitus at the Grenoble Institute for Neurosciences, France. All images were acquired at the IRMAGE facility using a 3T Philips Achieva MRI machine. They include a T1w scan, a resting-state BOLD fMRI scan, and a diffusion weighted imaging scan. Demographic variables include age, hearing-loss, tinnitus handicap inventory scores and duration since tinnitus onset.   


This dataset contains both raw and preprocessed data (and other "derivatives"), available on Openneuro. To date, only the raw data is available; we are in the process of uploading the derivatives.

The contents of this dataset are described in detail in the preprint: Specific connectivity with Operculum 3 (OP3) brain region in acoustic trauma tinnitus: a seed-based resting state fMRI study
